# `fitR` - Simple Growth Rate Estimation from OD data in R

## Goal: 
  - easy to use package to estimate growth rates using linear fits oversliding window.

## How to install

To install `fitR` you need the `devtools` package https://github.com/hadley/devtools which can be installed from CRAN. Once installed you can run the following code to get the latest stable `fitR`:
