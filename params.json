Once installed you can run the following code to get the latest stable `fitR`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"dcangst/fitr\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nor to get a specific version:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"dcangst/fitr\", ref=\"v0.4\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## to do / ideas\r\n  - examples\r\n  - minimize steps before fitting routine, ideally directly from plate reader data\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
